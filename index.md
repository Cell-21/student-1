title: About me (Xavier Celis)

## About my life 
Hello, My name is Xavier Celis. I love to play basketball and video games. I speak a little bit of spanish and Japanese. My dad was in the United States Marines Corps. I was born in Houston, Texas. I lived in 29 palms before moving to Okinawa Japan. I lived in Japan for 6 years and learned to speak and write some japanese. After not speaking or writing it for 3 years since we moved away I have forgotten most of it. I am very close to my family because growing up I didn't really have anyone else aside from them.
